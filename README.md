## Code and synthetic data

### Install packages


### Install latex for IEEE journal acceptable fonts
Also install poppler for inspecting fonts in PDF

```bash
apt-get update
apt-get install -y texlive-latex-base texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-fonts-extra dvipng ghostscript cm-super
sudo apt install -y poppler-utils
```
